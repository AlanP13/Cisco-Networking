# Comprehensive Network Infrastructure Simulation using CISCO

This project involved designing a comprehensive network infrastructure for a company to provide secure access to its resources. The infrastructure included VPN, department access, FTP, email servers, and a company webpage. The project utilized tools such as Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, ARP, VLSM, and RIPv2 to simulate the network infrastructure, analyze network traffic, map IP addresses to MAC addresses, divide the network into subnets, and use routing protocols. The project required skills in network design, routing protocols, subnetting, and network security. The successful implementation of the network resulted in an efficient and secure system that can handle data traffic and provide secure access to the company's resources.
